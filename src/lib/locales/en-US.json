        "howCreditsWork": {
          "question": "How do credits work?",
          "answer": "New users receive free credits to get started. Each completed practice interview uses 1 credit. You can purchase more credits anytime through our billing page. Credits never expire, so use them at your own pace."
        },
        "difference": {
          "question": "What's the difference between B2C and B2B?",
          "answer": "B2C (Interview Practice) is for individual candidates who want to practice and improve their interview skills. B2B (Recruiter Platform) is for organizations that want to evaluate candidates with structured interviews and scorecards. Both are powered by the same AI technology."
        },
        "multiTenancy": {
          "question": "How does multi-tenancy work?",
          "answer": "Vocaid is built with enterprise-grade multi-tenancy from the ground up. Each organization gets isolated data storage, separate API credentials, and configurable permissions. Your data never mixes with other customers, and you can set up sub-tenants for different departments or business units."
        },
        "whiteLabel": {
          "question": "Can we white-label the interview experience?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Our white-label controls let you customize the interview interface with your brand colors, logo, fonts, and messaging. Candidates see your brand throughout the entire experience. Enterprise plans include advanced theming options and custom domain support."
        },
        "billing": {
          "question": "How does billing work?",
          "answer": "For B2C users, we use a credit-based system. Purchase credit packs via Mercado Pago — the more you buy, the more you save. For B2B organizations, we offer flexible plans with volume discounts and custom billing arrangements."
        },
        "compliance": {
          "question": "What about GDPR and LGPD compliance?",
          "answer": "Vocaid is designed with privacy regulations in mind. We support data subject requests, provide data export functionality, and offer data residency options for EU and Brazil. Our processing agreements and security certifications are available upon request for compliance review."
        },
        "atsIntegration": {
          "question": "Can we export interview data to our ATS?",
          "answer": "Yes. Vocaid integrates with major ATS platforms through our SDK and webhooks. You can automatically push scorecards, transcripts, and evaluation data to your existing systems. We also provide a REST API for custom integrations with any platform."
        },
        "multilingual": {
          "question": "Do you support multilingual interviews?",
          "answer": "Yes, Vocaid supports interviews in multiple languages. Our AI can conduct interviews and generate scorecards in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, and more. Language detection happens automatically, or you can specify the interview language upfront."
        },
        "security": {
          "question": "How secure is the interview data?",
          "answer": "All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.3. We maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance, conduct regular penetration testing, and provide detailed audit logs. Enterprise customers can enable additional security controls including IP allowlisting and SSO."
        },
        "trial": {
          "question": "Is there a free trial available?",
          "answer": "Yes! All new users get free credits to try Vocaid with no credit card required. Use them to experience AI-powered interviews before purchasing more. For B2B organizations, we offer extended trials with custom terms."
